```
npm install
npm start # does not work, uses node-js dev server API
npm run start-cli # works, can't find the difference
```

Open [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080)

Next edit `.content` in `modules/styles.css`, maybe just change the
background color.

Note that the console reports an HMR update but nothing updates :(
